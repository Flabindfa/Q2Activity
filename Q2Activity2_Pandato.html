<center><p>It couldn't have been me.<br>
See, the direction the spackle protrudes.<br>
A noisy neighbor? An angry boyfriend? I'll never know. I wasn't home.<br>
I peer inside for a clue.</p>

<p>No! I can't see. I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun.<br>
But it's too late. My retinas.<br>
Already scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image.<br>
It's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright.<br>
It was too deep.</p>

<p>Stretching forever into everything.<br>
A hole of infinite choices.<br>
I realize now, that I wasn't looking in.<br>
I was looking out.<br>
And he, on the other side, was looking in.</p>
